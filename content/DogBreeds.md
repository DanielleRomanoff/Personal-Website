When I began this project, the general question I wanted to answer was why do dogs bite? Is it nature or nurture. As I searched for data on this subject, I began finding how difficult it would be to answer those two questions. Why? There are many reasons but the biggest hurdles include a lack of a centralized reporting system for dog bites. Dog bite incidents are reported to one of many agencies which then do not share that information with the others. For example, the emergency room, the police, the veterinarian are just a few. This makes meaningful analysis to answer my initial question nearly impossible.
